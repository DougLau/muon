## MuON v0.3.0alpha

*Micro Object Notation*

**MuON** is a format for configuration files and data interchange â€” as
expressive as other formats, but [much simpler](WHY.md).

### Specification

**MuON** files are [Unicode](https://home.unicode.org/) text encoded in
[UTF-8](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UTF-8), with no
[byte-order mark](https://unicode.org/glossary/#byte_order_mark).  Since UTF-8
does not allow
[surrogate code points](https://unicode.org/glossary/#surrogate_code_point),
all characters are
[Unicode scalars](https://unicode.org/glossary/#unicode_scalar_value).

Every *line feed* (U+000A) marks the end of a **line**.  There are three types:
*blank*, *comment* and *definition*.  **Blank** lines contain no characters.
**Comments** begin with zero or more spaces, followed by a number sign:
```muon
# Example comment
```

A **definition** maps a *key* to a *value*, with a colon and space `: ` between,
like so:
```muon
key: value
```
If the value is empty, the space is not required.

Some definitions can create **branches**.  Starting from a *root record*, all
branches form a tree.  With no *indents*, definitions are contained in the root.
After a branch, subsequent definitions with one more indent are contained in it.
```muon
key_in_root: value in root
branch:
  key_in_branch: value in branch
```

Definition **indents** are exactly 2, 3 or 4 spaces (U+0020).  Nested branches
use multiple *indents*.  The number of spaces must be the same for all indents
in a file.
```muon
mesa:
   # One indent; 3 spaces
   comida: taco
   bandeja:
      # Two indents; 6 spaces
      nota: Lo dejo
```

A **key** is a sequence of one or more characters.  It must be `"`**quoted**`"`
if it contains a colon or begins with a space, quote mark or number sign.  When
*quoted*, all contained quote marks are escaped by doubling:
```muon
# "skeleton" key must be quoted
"""skeleton"" key": value
```

Also, a key *should* be quoted if it contains
[homoglyphs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homoglyph#Unicode_homoglyphs)
of colon, contains
[control characters](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unicode_control_characters)
or begins with [whitespace](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Whitespace_character).

*Record* keys are often used in programming languages as
[identifiers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Identifier#In_computer_languages).
For compatibility, they should contain only ASCII alphanumeric or underscore
characters.

A **value** is a sequence of characters.  With the exception of *line feed*, any
Unicode character is allowed.

### Schema

A **schema** is a template with *types* as values.  It can either be separate or
prepended to a MuON file.  In either case, it begins and ends with a line of
three colons.

```muon
:::
# Example MuON schema
movie: list record
  title: text
  director: text Alan Smithee
  cast: list text
  release: list record
    release_date: date
    region: text
  gross: int
  emoji: optional text
:::
```

There are ten available **types**: `text`, `bool`, `int`, `number`, `datetime`,
`date`, `time`, `record`, `dictionary` and `any`.  They are used to parse
**objects** from *values*.

A **modifier** may precede the type, either `optional` or `list`.  One space
is between the *modifier* and *type*.

A **default** value can follow the *type*, with a single space between them.
They are used when a definition is not present.  Defaults are not allowed for
`record`, `dictionary`, `any` or `optional` types.

**Text** is a sequence of characters.
```muon
:::
greeting: text Hello!
farewell: text Goodbye!
:::
# greeting is Hello!
farewell: Be seeing you.
```

Because values cannot contain *line feeds*, text definitions must be
**appended** to represent them.  This is done with a **text append** separator,
which is `:>` instead of the usual `: `Â between the key and value.  A *line
feed* is inserted before each appended value.

When appending, use a **blank** key â€” a sequence of spaces with the same number
of characters as the key.

```muon
lyric: Out in the garden
     :>There's half of a heaven
```

**Bool** is a *boolean*: either `true` or `false`.
```muon
earth_is_flat: false
```

**Int** is an *integer* (whole number) in one of three forms:

  * *Decimal*: sequence of digits `0`-`9` (not starting with `0`).  May have a
    `+` or `-` sign prefix
  * *Binary*: `0b` followed by sequence of digits `0` or `1`
  * *Hexadecimal*: `0x` followed by sequence of digits `0`-`9`, `A`-`F` or
    `a`-`f`

An underscore may be inserted between digits to improve readability.

```muon
locke: 4
reyes: 0b1000
ford: 0x0F
jarrah: +16
shephard: 0b01_0111
kwon: 0x2a
```

A **number** is a
[floating point](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IEEE_754) number, made up of
these parts:
  1. *Whole number* part (same as decimal int)
  2. *Fractional* part (decimal point followed by sequence of digits `0`-`9`)
  3. *Exponent* part (`e` followed by decimal int)

One or both of the whole or fractional parts must be present, but the exponent
part is not required.  As with ints, underscores may be included.

The values `inf` and `NaN` stand for *infinity* and *not a number*,
respectively.  Either can be prefixed with a `+` or `-` sign.

```muon
prime: 37
log_e_2: .6931471805599453
mercury: -38.83440
planck: 6.626_070_15e-34
buzz: +inf
avogadro: 6.022_140_76e23
```

**Datetime** is *date*, *time* and *offset*, as specified by `date-time`
from [RFC 3339](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc3339#section-5.6).  The date and
time are separated by an uppercase `T` only.  If the offset is represented by
`Z`, it must also be uppercase.
```muon
moonwalk: 1969-07-21T02:56:00Z
```

**Date** is *year*, *month* and *day*, as specified by `full-date` from
[RFC 3339](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc3339#section-5.6).
```muon
birthday: 2019-08-01
```

**Time** is *hour*, *minute* and *second*, as specified by `partial-time` from
[RFC 3339](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc3339#section-5.6).
```muon
start: 08:00:00
end: 15:58:14.593849001
```

A **record** is a *branch* containing *fields* as subsequent definitions.
```muon
:::
book: record
  title: text
  author: text
  year: int
:::
book:
  title: If on a winter's night a traveler
  author: Italo Calvino
  year: 1979
```

Since records do not use their *values*, they can **substitute** for the first
*field*, which must then be left out.  Substitution is not allowed for `record`,
`dictionary`, `any` or `optional` fields.
```muon
book: The Left Hand of Darkness
  author: Ursula K. Le Guin
  year: 1969
```

A **dictionary** is a *branch* for associative arrays â€” useful if keys are not
known in advance.  The schema must contain a single definition with types for
both *key* and *value*.  The key type is restricted to `text`, `bool`, `int`,
`number`, `datetime`, `date` or `time`.
```muon
:::
num_word: dictionary
  text: int
:::
num_word:
  fifty: 50
  one: 1
  thirteen: 13
```

**Any** is a *branch* containing data of any type.  It should be used for data
which does not fit into a rigid schema.
```muon
:::
product: list record
  name: text
  price: number
  details: any
:::
product: duct tape
  price: 4.99
  details:
    color: silver
    width: 8 cm
product: machete
  price: 29.99
  details:
    length: 50 cm
    weight: 0.5 kg
```

**Optional** types are not required â€” the absence of a definition represents
a `None` or `null` value.
```muon
:::
name: text
occupation: optional text
:::
name: Surfer Joe
# no occupation
```

A **list** is parsed as a sequence of *objects*, separated by spaces.  If a
*list* is empty, omit its definition.
```muon
:::
show_times: list time
healthy_snacks: list text
:::
show_times: 15:40:00 18:00:00 20:20:00
# no healthy_snacks
```

Like text, *lists* can be *appended*.  All *objects* are added to the end.
```muon
fibonacci: 0 1 1 2 3
         : 5 8 13 21 34
# same as fibonacci: 0 1 1 2 3 5 8 13 21 34
```

When appending to **list record** or **list dictionary**, the key cannot be
blank, since the definitions are not consecutive.
```muon
person: George Washington
  birthday: 1732-02-22
person: Abraham Lincoln
  birthday: 1809-02-12
```

For **list text**, *objects* are separated by spaces, just like other lists.  If
a text *object* contains spaces, use the **text value** separator `:=` to treat
an entire *value* as a single *object*.  The *text append* separator `:>` will
also append an entire *value* to the previous text *object*.
```muon
shopping: avocado banana
        :=cream cheese
        : cucumber
        :=ice cream
        : raw
        :>burger! (mmmm)
```
