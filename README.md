## MuON v0.1.2

*Micro Object Notation*

**MuON** is a format for data interchange ‚Äî like
[JSON](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JSON) ‚Äî but different in important ways:
  * *Line-oriented* ‚Äî essentially a tree of key/value pairs
  * Easy to read and write even for non-programmers
  * *Schemas* can be defined
  * Comments are allowed!

```
# Example MuON document
sample: Text can contain "quotes" and colons (:)
the_dict:
    a: 13
    b: true
    poem: Once upon a midnight dreary, ‚Ä¶ üåë + üåÅ?
    pi: 3.141592653589793
```

### Specification

**MuON** documents are [UTF-8 encoded](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UTF-8)
with no [byte-order mark](https://unicode.org/glossary/#byte_order_mark).
Since UTF-8 does not allow
[surrogate code points](https://unicode.org/glossary/#surrogate_code_point),
all characters are
[Unicode scalars](https://unicode.org/glossary/#unicode_scalar_value).

Each document is a *tree* of **dictionaries** (hash tables), with an implied
**root**.

Every line feed (U+000A) marks the end of a **line**.  There are three valid
line types: *blank*, *comment* and *definition*.  A **blank** line contains no
characters.  **Comments** begin with zero or more spaces followed by a number
sign:

`# Example comment`

A **definition** creates a mapping between a **key** and **value**, like so:
```
key: value
```

With no **indents**, mappings are created for the root dictionary.  If a
mapping defines a new dictionary, subsequent definitions with an additional
indent are for that dictionary.

```
key in root: value in root
a:
    key in a: value in a
```

Every indent in a document must contain the same number of spaces, typically
2 to 4.  Only spaces (U+0020) are allowed, not tabs or other whitespace.  For
nested dictionaries, multiple indents are used.

```
mesa:
   # 3 space indent; ok
   comida: taco
   bandeja:
      # Two indents: 6 spaces
      nota: Lo dejo
```

A **key** is a sequence of one or more characters.  It must be `"`**quoted**`"`
if it contains a colon or begins with a space, quote mark or number sign.  When
*quoted*, all contained quote marks must be escaped by doubling:

`"skeleton" key` ‚áí `"""skeleton"" key"`

Also, a key *should* be quoted if it contains any colon
[homoglyphs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homoglyph#Unicode_homoglyphs),
[control characters](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unicode_control_characters)
or begins with [whitespace](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Whitespace_character).

It is common to use keys directly within programming languages as
[identifiers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Identifier#In_computer_languages).
In this case, they should only contain ASCII alphanumeric and underscore
characters.

A **value** is a sequence of characters.  If empty, the space after the colon
in the definition is not required.

### Schema

A **schema** is a document template with all values containing types.  It can
either be separate or prepended to a document.  In either case, it begins and
ends with a line of three colons.

```
:::
# Sample schema
sample: text
the_dict: dict
    a: int
    b: bool
    poem: text
    d: float
:::
```

A **type** is one of the following:

Basic   | Optional |   List
------- | -------- | ---------
`text`  | `text?`  | `[text]`
`bool`  | `bool?`  | `[bool]`
`int`   | `int?`   | `[int]`
`float` | `float?` | `[float]`
`dict`  | `dict?`  | `[dict]`

**Optional** types (with a question mark) are not required ‚Äî their definition
may not be present.

**Text** is a sequence of characters.  Because values cannot contain line
feeds, the only way for text to contain them is by **appending**.  This is done
with extra definitions using a **blank** key: spaces in a sequence of the same
length.  A line feed will be inserted before the appended text.

```
text: value
    : appended
```

**Bool** is a *boolean*: either `true` or `false`.

**Int** is an *integer* (whole number) in one of three forms:

  * *Decimal*: sequence of digits `0`-`9` (not starting with `0`).  May have a
    sign prefix `+` or `-`
  * *Binary*: `0b` followed by sequence of digits `0` or `1`
  * *Hexadecimal*: `0x` followed by sequence of digits `0`-`9`, `A`-`F` or
    `a`-`f`

An underscore may be inserted between digits to improve readability.

```
decimal_a: 4
binary_a: 0b1000
hexadecimal_a: 0x0F
decimal_b: +16
binary_b: 0b01_0111
hexadecimal_b: 0x2a
```

A **float** is a
[floating point](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IEEE_754) number, made up of
these parts:
  1. Whole number part (same as decimal int)
  2. Fractional part (decimal point followed by sequence of digits `0`-`9`)
  3. Exponent part (`e` followed by decimal int)

One or both of the whole or fractional parts must be present, but the exponent
part is not required.  As with ints, underscores may be included.

The values `inf` and `NaN` stand for *infinity* and *not a number*,
respectively.  Either can be prefixed with a `+` or `-` sign.

```
float0: -1.5
float1: .0195
float2: 1e-10
float3: 13.835e12
float4: +inf
float5: 100
```

A **dict** is a *record* containing indented mappings from keys to values.

```
:::
things: dict
    alpha: int
    beta: text
:::
things:
    alpha: 15
    beta: What have you
```

Since dictionaries do not have *values* themselves, they can be used as a short
cut for the first contained mapping.  The only restriction is that mapping must
not have a dictionary type.

```
things: 15
    beta: alpha is equal to 15
```

A **list** is a type `[`enclosed in square brackets`]`.  Values are sequences
of the contained type, separated by spaces.  Like optional types, the
definition should be omitted if the list is empty.

```
:::
flags: [bool]
checks: [bool]
:::
flags: true false true true
# checks list is empty
```

Like text, lists can be **appended**.  All items are added to the end of the
list.

```
numbers: 2 4 6 8
       : 10 12 14 16
# same as numbers: 2 4 6 8 10 12 14 16
```

To append to a **list of dictionaries**, the key is included as normal.

```
:::
dict_list: [dict]
    a: int
:::
dict_list:
    a: 5
dict_list:
    a: 10
```

For a **list of text** containing spaces or line feeds, a double colon can be
used to treat values as a single item in the list.

```
:::
text_list: [text]
:::
text_list: first second
         :: third item
         : fourth fifth
         :: sixth
         :: item
         : seventh
```
